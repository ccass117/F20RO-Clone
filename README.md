##Clone of F20RO Coursework, with evolutionary robotics

# F20RO-Group4
* TASK 1: Create a BBR approach that solves the T-Maze Arena
* TASK 2: Create an ER approach that solves the T-maze Arena
* Needs to be completed in the shortest time possible
* Think about more complex behaviours we can implement
* Design the robot for increasingly complex mazes, as long as both models can do a maze in <5 mins

Constraints:
* No GPS nodes
* No moving walls in the maze
* Arena dimensions cannot be changed
* Maximum time to perform tasks is 5 mins

For each task:
* Activity 1: Choose the corresponding project repo from lab material
* Activity 2: Choose the appropriate arena env for each model
* Activity 3: Run and test controller on arena envs
* Activity 4: Record the best runs for each T-maze, and collect data for illustrating the final robot behaviours and statsistics for comparing models.

## TO DO List:

  # Setup:
  * Group Signing Sheet
  * Set up a report document
  * Make T-Maze A and B
    * We need to make some arena modifications too, like different light placements or something. 

  # Task 1:
  * Make a BBR approach for the bot
    * Sensors for light detection
    * Wall-following and obstacle avoidance
 
  # Task 2:
  * Make an ER approach for the bot
    * Fitness functions, evolutionary parameters etc.

  # Testing
  * Test BBR on T-Mazes 
  * Test ER on T-Mazes
    * Record time to reward, collisions, path efficiency etc.

  # Write Report
  * Record videos of the best runs of controllers in each maze
  * Introduction
  * Methods & Implementation
  * Results & Analysis
  * Discussion & Conclusion
  * We need to add references ew
